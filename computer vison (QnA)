### **Q1. What are path-finding algorithms? Explain any one path-finding algorithm in detail with its working steps.**
**Answer:**
Path-finding algorithms are techniques used to find an optimal route between two points (start and goal) while avoiding obstacles.  
They are essential in robotics and autonomous navigation, where an agent must plan a safe and efficient path.
#### Common Path-Finding Algorithms:
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
- A* (A-star) Algorithm  
- BFS / DFS  
- D* and RRT (used in dynamic environments)
#### **A* (A-star) Algorithm – Explained**
**Purpose:**  
To find the shortest path between two points using both *actual distance traveled* and *estimated distance to the goal*.

**Concept:**
Each node has:
- `g(n)` → cost from start to node *n*  
- `h(n)` → heuristic estimate from *n* to goal  
- `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)` → total estimated cost

**Steps:**
1. Initialize an *open list* (to explore) and *closed list* (already explored).
2. Add the start node to the open list.
3. Repeat until goal found:
   - Pick node with smallest `f(n)` from open list.
   - Move it to closed list.
   - For each neighbour:
     - If not in closed list, compute `f(n) = g + h`.
     - If better path found, update parent and cost.
4. Stop when goal reached — backtrack using parent links to form path.

**Heuristic:**  
For a grid, `h(n)` = Euclidean or Manhattan distance to goal.

**Advantages:**
- Combines optimality of Dijkstra and efficiency of greedy search.
- Works well for maps and robot navigation.

**Disadvantages:**
- Slower in large grids.
- Heuristic must be admissible (not overestimate).
